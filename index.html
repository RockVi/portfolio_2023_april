        <h3>A bit of me</h3>
        <p>I had a keen interest in art and communication expressions, as well as different types of knowledge, which I had always wished to explore further. Knowing that I needed to find a way to incorporate my interests into my career, I made the decision to learn web development. This would not only allow me to express my creativity but also integrate math and logic into my routines, as well as problem breakdown.</p>
        <p>It was a challenging transition, but I believe it has allowed me to unlock my creativity in numerous new ways. I now have the ability to construct something from scratch and experiment with various designs, layouts, and functionalities.</p>
        <p>My career has taken a new dimension since I started exploring web development. I feel like I'm constantly learning, and I'm excited to see where this path will take me.</p>
